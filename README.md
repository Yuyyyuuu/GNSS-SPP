# GNSS-SPP: GNSS Signal Processing and Positioning

## Introduction

GNSS-SPP is a software project developed using standard C/C++ languages, designed to operate on a PC platform to fetch real-time data such as pseudoranges, Doppler frequency shifts, and broadcast ephemerides from an OEM719 board card. The project aims to perform navigation, positioning, velocity (PVT) calculations, and output the positioning results and accuracy statistics in real-time within the Windows command line environment.

## Features

- Real-time acquisition of GNSS data: Pseudoranges, Doppler frequency shifts, and broadcast ephemeris.
- PVT solution: Navigation positioning, velocity, and time calculation.
- Real-time navigation: Display of positioning results and accuracy statistics in the Windows command line.
- Accuracy statistics: Output of positioning accuracy metrics.

## System Requirements

- Operating System: Windows
- Compiler: Standard C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
- Hardware: GNSS receiver compatible with the OEM719 board card

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Yuyyyuuu/GNSS-SPP.git
   ```
2. Open the project directory and compile the source code using your preferred IDE or command-line compiler.
3. Ensure your PC is equipped with an OEM719 board card and that the necessary drivers are installed.

## Usage

1. Execute the compiled program.
2. Monitor the real-time positioning data and accuracy statistics displayed in the Windows command line.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome. This includes:
- Reporting bugs
- Submitting fixes
- Proposing new features
